GhostTalk.com is a project for UF class CIS4301 developed by Calvin Moore, Dominic Kotwica, and Christian Argueta.  The inspiration behind the functionality of the website is a mixture between Facebook and Snapchat, as the temporary posts of Snapchat are combined with the option to keep posts permanently viewable.  GhostTalk.com allows for the best of both worlds, a way to have a private life but still share special moments with family and friends.
